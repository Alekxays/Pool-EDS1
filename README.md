# 💻 Pool | EDS

Welcome to my repository for the first-year pool at Epitech Digital School! 🎓

This repo contains all the exercises I submitted during the pool. It serves as a resource for understanding my coding approach and problem-solving methods.

**⚠️ A Friendly Reminder**

While you are free to explore and learn from my code, I strongly discourage copying and pasting it without understanding how it works. Instead, I encourage you to:

	1.	🧐 Read the code carefully.
	2.	🧩 Decipher the logic and processes.
	3.	🔧 Experiment with your own solutions!

#### 💡 Remember: There is no single way to write code. My solutions are one of many possibilities to solve the exercises you’re looking at. 🚀

## 📂 Content

This repository includes exercises written in JavaScript covering a variety of programming concepts, such as:

	•	📚 Basics: Variables, loops, conditionals, and functions.
	•	🔗 Data Structures: Arrays, objects, and their manipulation.
	•	⚙️ Algorithms: Problem-solving approaches using JavaScript.
	•	🌐 Advanced Topics: ES6+ features, callbacks, and more.

## 🛠️ Usage

**1. Clone the Repository**

	git clone https://github.com/Alekxays/Pool-EDS1.git
	cd pool-eds

**2. Explore and Learn**

Each exercise is located in its own folder, with clear naming to help you find what you’re looking for.

**3. Run the Code**

To execute the JavaScript code, you can use:

#### •	Node.js: Install Node.js and run:

	node filename.js


#### •	Browser Console: Copy the code into your browser’s developer console for immediate results.
